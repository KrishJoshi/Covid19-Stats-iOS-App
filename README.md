### Installing
Unfortunalty Apple doesn't allow COVID related apps on the App Store so only option is to using a 3rd party ipa installer or building this project on XCode.

Use Covid Stats.xcworkspace when opening this app on XCode insted of Covid Stats.xcodeproj

### Running
**Main App**
The app has two main sections today and summary. Today will show the latest figures while Summary shows total stats. On the top right of the app there's sort where you can change the way you see the details. 

**Widget**
After adding the widget, user can long press the widget and click on "Edit 'Covid Stats'", here user can select the country they would like to see the stats for.
