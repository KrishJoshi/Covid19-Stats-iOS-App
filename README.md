### Demo

### Installing
Unfortunalty Apple doesn't allow COVID related apps on the App Store so only option is to using a 3rd party ipa installer or building this project on XCode.

Use Covid Stats.xcworkspace when opening this app on XCode insted of Covid Stats.xcodeproj

### Running 

### Mention
Thanks to @aaryankotharii for creating [Corona-Widget](https://github.com/aaryankotharii/Corona-Widget). It's was used as a Fork and inspiration for this project.
